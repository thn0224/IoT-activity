Do some research. What sensors does your phone have?
- Iphone 13: Face-ID Sensor, Barometer, Three-Axis-Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Proximity Sensor, Ambient Light Sensor, Digital Compass, Cameras, Button, Microphone

What do you think happens if the sensor returns a higher voltage than was sent (for example coming from an external power supply)?
- damage to the sensor or circuitry
- incorrect sensor readings or malfunctions
- potential damage to the power supply
- risk of short circuits
- protection mechanisms (if present)

Do some research. What actuators does your phone have?
- Taptic Engine (Vibration Motor), Speakers, OLED Display, Camera Actuators, Face ID and TrueDepth Camera System, Flash (LED Flash), MagSafe System (Magnetic Actuators), Haptic Feedback (via Touchscreen), Vibration Alert for Calls or Notifications,
Vibration for Wake-Up and Lock, Volume Buttons, Side Button (Power Button)

What do you think happens if the IoT device sends a higher voltage than the actuator can handle?
- damage to the actuator
- malfunction or erratic behavior
- fire hazard or short circuits
- power supply instability
- protection mechanisms (if present)

How would you keep the motor rotation smooth, especially at low speeds? Would you use a small number of long pulses with long pauses or lots of very short pulses with very short pauses?
- low speeds, using a series of short pulses with short pauses (high-frequency PWM) --> smoother motion allows the motor to receive constant power in small amounts, keeping the motor from "sticking" or jerking between states

What other simple 2-state actuators can you think of? One example is a solenoid, which is an electromagnet that can be activated to do things like move a door bolt locking/unlocking a door.
- Buzzers (Piezoelectric or Electromagnetic): buzzer emits sound when activated by a digital HIGH signal and stays silent when LOW
- Motors (On/Off Control): motors can have variable speed control, a simple digital actuator version would just turn ON (spin) or OFF (stop)
- Heating Elements (Binary Operation): some heating elements operate in a simple ON/OFF manner, activating when a current is applied and stopping when it's removed
- Relays: relay is an electrically controlled switch that toggles between ON and OFF states
