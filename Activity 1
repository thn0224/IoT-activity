How much of the data generated by IoT devices is actually used, and how much is wasted? Why is so much data ignored?
- 10-20% of IoT-generated data is actually used for decision-making, analytics, or automation
- 80-90% of IoT data is discarded or never analyzed
- Getting ignored because of redundancy, cost constraints, lack of infrastructure, privacy & security concerns etc.

For each of the areas described below, find one concrete example that's not given in the text.
- Consumer IoT --> Smart door lock: allows homeowners to lock and unlock doors remotely using a smartphone app, voice commands, or automated schedules;
                                    security and convenience by enabling keyless entry and the ability to grant access to guests or service providers without physical keys
               --> What consumer IoT devices do you have on your person or in your home? Smart door lock, robotic vacuum cleaner

- Commercial IoT --> Smart Dash Cam: Companies like Motive provide AI-powered dash cams for vehicle fleets, detect risky driving behaviors and provide real-time audio and visual alerts to help drivers correct their actions
                                     for safety and reducing accidents
                 --> What commercial IoT devices do you have in your school or workplace? Integrated Campus Management System (ICMS), Flexible Assembly Learning Factory (workstations and auxiliary components, featuring a material flow monitoring system utilizing RFID technology),
                                                                                          modern Laboratories with IoT Technologies ( IoT platforms, smart sensors, data centers, and collaborative robots)

- Industrial IoT (IIoT) --> Autonomous Tractorsâ€‹: self-driving tractors equipped with multiple stereo cameras to capture a 360-degree view of the field, operate within geofenced areas, allowing for precise and efficient farming operations
                        --> What other IoT devices could help farmers? Autonomous Field Robots, Soil Nutrient Analyzers, Electric Fencing with IoT Alerts,  Smart Beehive Monitors

- Infrastructure IoT --> Smart Parking Solutions: Libelium has introduced a Smart Parking solution that allows citizens to detect available parking spots using IoT-enabled sensors, reduces traffic congestion and improves urban mobility
                     --> If you could add IoT devices to measure anything where you live, what would it be? air quality monitoring sensors, helping residents make informed decisions about outdoor activities and supporting initiatives to improve environmental health
