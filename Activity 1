How much of the data generated by IoT devices is actually used, and how much is wasted? Why is so much data ignored?
- 10-20% of IoT-generated data is actually used for decision-making, analytics, or automation
- 80-90% of IoT data is discarded or never analyzed
- Getting ignored because of redundancy, cost constraints, lack of infrastructure, privacy & security concerns etc.

List as many IoT devices as you can that are in your home, school or workplace - there may be more than you think!
--> At Home:
- Smartphones & Smartwatches – These are IoT devices because they collect sensor data and connect to the cloud
- Smart Speakers (Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomePod) – Voice-controlled assistants that connect to the internet
- Smart TVs & Streaming Devices (Chromecast, Apple TV, Fire Stick) – They stream content over WiFi
- Smart Plugs & Bulbs (Philips Hue, TP-Link, Xiaomi Smart Bulbs) – Control lights and power remotely
- Smart Thermostats – Control home temperature intelligently (not common in Vietnam but exists in some places)
- Smart Door Locks – Unlock doors with an app or fingerprint
- WiFi Routers & Mesh Networks – Many modern routers have IoT features like remote monitoring
- Security Cameras (Ring, Arlo, Xiaomi, Hikvision, etc.) – Detect motion and record footage
- Robot Vacuums (Roomba, Xiaomi, Dreame, etc.) – Use sensors to navigate and clean autonomously

--> At VGU:
- Smart Projectors & Interactive Whiteboards – Used for teaching and collaboration
- Security Cameras & Motion Sensors – For campus surveillance and security
- Access Control Systems (RFID Student Cards, Fingerprint Scanners) – Used at entry gates, labs, and libraries
- Environmental Sensors – Some campuses have smart air quality monitors or temperature sensors
- Smart Lighting & Energy Management Systems – Automated lighting that saves energy
- Lab Equipment with IoT Integration – Some science/engineering labs may have IoT-enabled instruments

Assignement:
- IoT Project Research: Thu Thiem Eco Smart City
- Location: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
- Description: The Thu Thiem Eco Smart City is a large-scale IoT-integrated urban development in Ho Chi Minh City’s Thu Thiem area. Developed by Lotte Group, the $2.2 billion project aims to create a high-tech, sustainable city featuring smart infrastructure, efficient energy usage, and advanced public services. 
The city will use IoT sensors, AI-driven analytics, and automation to improve areas such as traffic management, public safety, energy consumption, and environmental sustainability.

- Upsides (Benefits) of the Project:
--> Sustainability & Environmental Benefits
- city incorporates smart energy grids and green building technologies to reduce carbon emissions and energy waste
- automated waste management and air quality monitoring ensure a cleaner, healthier urban environment
--> Improved Traffic & Transportation
- smart traffic lights and real-time monitoring systems will reduce congestion and optimize road usage
- IoT-enabled public transport tracking will provide commuters with real-time updates on bus and metro schedules
--> Economic Growth & Modernization
- by attracting foreign investors, businesses, and startups, the project creates new job opportunities
- city will enhance Ho Chi Minh City’s global reputation as a modern tech hub, encouraging further development
--> Better Public Services & Safety
- IoT-powered surveillance systems can help enhance security and emergency response times
- smart city infrastructure will enable efficient water and electricity distribution, reducing resource waste

- Downsides (Challenges) of the Project:
--> Community Displacement & Social Impact
- construction of the smart city requires land clearance, forcing some residents and businesses to relocate
- compensation and resettlement programs must be fair and properly managed to avoid social inequality
--> High Costs & Maintenance
- building and maintaining an IoT-powered smart city is expensive, requiring continuous investment in new technology and infrastructure
- if not planned correctly, budget overruns could slow down the project’s progress
--> Privacy & Data Security Risks
- IoT systems will collect large amounts of personal and location data from residents
- strong cybersecurity measures are necessary to prevent hacking or misuse of sensitive information
--> Environmental Impact of Construction
- while the project aims for sustainability, the initial construction phase may lead to deforestation, pollution, and habitat loss
- measures must be taken to reduce the ecological footprint during development

- Privacy Considerations:
--> Data Collection & Transparency
- smart city will use IoT sensors to monitor movement, traffic, and personal data, raising privacy concerns
- overnment and private companies must implement clear data policies to ensure residents’ information is protected
--> Cybersecurity Measures
- to prevent cyber threats, smart city networks should use end-to-end encryption, regular security updates, and strict data access policies
- public awareness campaigns should educate residents on how their data is used and how they can protect their privacy

- Conclusion:
The Thu Thiem Eco Smart City is a transformational project that integrates IoT technology to improve urban living, reduce environmental impact, and boost economic growth. However, it also presents significant challenges, including social displacement, high costs, and privacy risks. 
If these issues are properly managed, the project could serve as a leading model for smart city development in Southeast Asia.
